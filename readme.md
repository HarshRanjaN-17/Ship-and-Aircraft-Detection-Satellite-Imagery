# Satellite Imagery Recognition


Recent advancements in AI have opened doors to various military applications like surveillance,
reconnaissance, and threat assessment. However, identifying military vehicles in aerial images
remains a challenge due to scale, illumination, and orientation variations. Additionally, the lack of
well-annotated datasets hampers the efficacy of deep learning algorithms in this domain. Despite
the potential benefits of AI in military contexts, several challenges persist. These include the need
for transparency in AI systems, ensuring robustness against data manipulation, and overcoming
data scarcity in military settings. In satellite imagery analytics, detecting small objects poses a
significant challenge, especially given the limited resolution of overhead imagery. To address this,
a project focused on exploring instance segmentation for military asset detection using transfer
learning, employing techniques such as MLP & CNN with data augmentation and dropouts, as
well as basic R-CNN models and ConvNets. The experiments aimed to analyze the effectiveness
of these approaches in distinguishing various types of military vehicles across different contexts,
including airborne and seaborne scenarios, demonstrating promising results in recognizing military
vehicles through deep architectures trained on customized datasets.
